# Catch-Only Models: What's the Catch?

# What's a Catch-Only Model

.center[*A model that seeks to infer something about stock status using only catch data**]

Catch-only models (COMs) gained popularity to fill two needs 
  - Estimating MSY in US to satisfy regulatory requirements (e.g. [DB-SRA](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165783611001962))
  - Turning only global fishery database, FAO captures, into estimates of stock status
  
We'll focus on the "stock status" side of COMs here

.footnote[*And usually structural assumptions + life history]

# COMS for Stock Status

There is a long history (and rationale) for trying to infer stock status from catch history
  - Under classical open-access dynamics, a build up, peak, then crash of catch probably means overfished

Early efforts started by looking at things like Catch / max(Catch) etc. 

Since then...

  - Empirical approaches (Costello et al. 2012/2016, Thorson et al. 2012)
  - Structural / Heuristic approaches (e.g. CMSY, SSCOM)
  - Ensemble approaches (Anderson et al. Superensemble)

# Where's the Information?

Regardless of performance, let's think for a moment about where information comes from in a COM

Just about the most foundational equation in stock assessment is


$$q \times biomass = \frac{catch}{effort}$$

Suppose we observe $\frac{catch}{effort}$.

What do we need to assume in order for this to be useful for us as index of abundance?

---


# Where's the Information?

Now suppose we just observe catch. 

$$effort \times q \times biomass = catch$$
What do we need to assume now?

--

We now need to assume that *effort* and *q* are constant if we want to equate catch to biomass.

How likely is that? 

Yes, I know this is obvious, but it's worth remembering! 

.center[**We need some really restrictive assumptions in order for catch ~ biomass**]


---

# Where's the information?

This is pretty obvious so far. That's why most COMs add a wrinkle: they try and estimate stock status based off the characteristics of the entire catch history.
  - catch / max(catch)
  - catch history shape
  
CMSY is one of the most common forms of this
  - Define priors on *r*, *k*, initial status, intermediate, and final stock status
  - Apply catch history + pop model to priors
  - Reject any combinations of parameters that result in biomass < 0
    - And do some filtering based on the "triangle".... 
    
The claim: you have now learned something from stock status

---

# Where's the information

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(here("presentations","imgs","cmsy.png"))
```


---

# Where's the Information

How is the prior on recent stock status getting "updated"?

*K* prior clearly matters: If your prior is that B/Bmsy ~ U(0,2), but your prior on K is barely larger than average catch, your "posterior" will say that B/Bmsy is low. 
  - Not learning though: what happens if K ~ U(0, Inf)?

Is it The shape of the catch history? 

A one way trip down has to mean the stock is probably in worse shape than a climb and then a steady level right?

---

# Where's the Information?

Experiment: 
  - Fix all priors at the same level
  
  - Apply the priors to starkly different catch histories
  
  - Compare prior and posterior for each run

```{r}

# Where's the Information?
.center[*The shape of the catch history on its own does not contain information on stock status*]

```{r}

# The Prior Remains the Same

```{r}

```

---

# COMs Don't Learn Stock Status from Catch

- COMs help reveal your implicit priors

- Estimates of stock status are a reflection of assumptions, not "learning"

- Can work just fine if your assumptions are right
  - Basically, if you can eyeball a surplus production model on your own (r & K), then you'll get the right stock status


**Focus then is on prior generation, not "learning" from catch history!!**

---

# What about the heuristics?

If you can't *learn* from catches alone, can you *predict*?
  - This is the idea underlying empirical approaches like Costello et al. 2012 & the heuristics internal to CMSY
  

.center[*Looking at stocks where we "know" stock status, can we identify predictable relationships between catches and stock status*]

# Unleash the Machines

What if the problem is just that we haven't found the *right* empirical COM?
- Train random forest to predict B/Bmsy using catch history + life history

```{r}
com_rf_plot
```


---

# You Can't Always Get What You Want

.pull-left[

The desires for COMS is understandable

Catches of course tell you something about the minimum possible population size

**On their own they do not reliably reveal or predict stock status**

Where next?
  - Can we augment COMs with other types of data to improve performance?
  - Not looking promising at macro scale so far...
