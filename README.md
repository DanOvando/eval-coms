# WHATâ€™S THE CATCH? A HISTORY AND EVALUATION OF CATCH-ONLY STOCK ASSESSMENT METHODS 

## Project Summary

Evaluation of inferential and predictive power of catch-only models, Ovando et al. In Prep

## Reproducing Results

This repository allows for reproduction of results based on prior-predictive tuning (influence of catch history shape) and predictive modeling. 

This project is set up with [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) to manage package dependencies. Inside R (and with your working directory set correctly) run `renv::restore()`. Follow all prompts. This will install the correct versions of all the packages needed to replicate our results. Packages are installed in a stand-alone project library for this paper, and will not affect your installed R packages anywhere else.
